As a user, I can transfer money to my friends for meal splits so that they can receive money on time, and I don't have to worry about the leakage of confidential information through bank transfers.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Money senders and receivers must have valid and verified accounts to ensure the trustworthiness of their identities.
2. Users should have the flexibility to choose the source of the funds they wish to send. Available options may include a bundled checking account or PayPal's digital wallet.

4. In case the balance in the digital wallet is insufficient, users should receive a notification via an alert message.
5. Once the user inputs the desired amount for the transfer, there should be a review session, allowing the user to perform a final check on both the transfer amount and the recipient.
6. Upon successful completion of the money transfer and the receiver's confirmation, both parties should receive a notification indicating that the transaction is complete.
7. All transactions should be securely recorded and accessible within the transaction history.
