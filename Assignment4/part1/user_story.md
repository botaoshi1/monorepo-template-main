As a user, I can transfer money to my friends for meal splits so that they can receive money on time, and I don't have to worry about the leakage of confidential information through bank transfers.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Money senders and receivers should both have valid and verified accounts to ensure the sender's and receiver's identities can be trusted.  
2. Users should be allowed to choose the source of the money to be sent from. The available options could include a bundled checking account or Paypal's digital wallet. If the balance in the digital wallet is insufficient, users should be notified with an alert message.  
3. After the user inputs the amount to be sent, there should be a review session for the user to perform a final check on the money amount and the receiver.  
4. When the money is sent and the receiver successfully receives it, both parties should receive a notification that the transaction is complete.  
5. All transactions should be recorded and viewable in the transaction history.
